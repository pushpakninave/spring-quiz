A quiz backend with rest

> Why I used GenerationType-> SEQUENCE instead of IDENTITY ?

> About update and delete methods in questionController ?

> About @ResponseEntity and @RequestEntity

> @RequestParam and @PathVariable difference

> Optional<> used in getQuizQuestions method in QuizService

A container object which may or may not contain a non-null value. If a value is present, isPresent() returns true. If no value is present, the object is considered empty and isPresent() returns false.

Additional methods that depend on the presence or absence of a contained value are provided, such as orElse() (returns a default value if no value is present) and ifPresent() (performs an action if a value is present).
